 * ButtonsCheckEvents function checks the current button states and returns
 * any events that have occured since its last call.  This function should be
 * called repeatedly in a Timer ISR, though it can be called in main() during
 * testing.
 *
 * In normal use, this function should only be used after ButtonsInit().
 *
 * This function should assume that the buttons start in an off state with value
 * 0. Therefore if no buttons are pressed when ButtonsCheckEvents() is first
 * called, BUTTONS_EVENT_NONE should be returned.
 *
 * @return  Each bit of the return value corresponds to one ButtonEvent flag,
 *          as described in Buttons.h.  If no events are detected,
 *          BUTTONS_EVENT_NONE is returned.
 *
 * Note that more than one event can occur simultaneously, though this
 * situation is rare. To handle this, the output should be a bitwise OR of
 * all applicable event flags.  For example, if button 1 was released at the
 * same time that button 2 was pressed, this function should return
 * (BUTTON_EVENT_1UP | BUTTON_EVENT_2DOWN).
